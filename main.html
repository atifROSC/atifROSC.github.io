              <h5 class="procedure-video-heading">The Pacing Wire</h5>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                The transvenous pacing wire is the very instrument that will be
                directing electrical Impulse to the heart, and so it is crucial
                that you are able to feed it to exactly where you want it.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Prior to placing the transvenous pacer, you will obviously need
                access if you haven’t obtained it already. Take a look here to
                get some guidance on venous access.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                It’s always a good idea to familiarize yourself with your
                equipment outside of a situation of necessity as well as just
                prior to your insertion. In your transvenous pacing kit you will
                find the wire itself, 2 yellow electrode pieces, an alligator
                clip to attach to the ECG machine for identifying capture, and a
                custom-made syringe. This is important to pay attention to as
                the syringe is built to retract a fixed amount that is less than
                the syringe capacity. This guarantees that you do not over
                inflate the TVP balloon, since over-inflation and rupture
                introduces a significant amount of air into the circulation. Be
                sure to only use this syringe. Lastly, you will have your TVP
                sterility sheath that will be placed over the wire to keep it
                clean at all times, especially if you need to adjust the depth
                after all is said and done.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you have access in ideally the right internal jugular or
                left subclavian vein and you have tested your TVP balloon, slide
                the sterility sheath onto the TVP wire and leave it contracted.
                On the other end, make sure your yellow electrode pieces are
                inserted into the positive and negative ends of the wire and
                plugged into the ventricular port on the generator wire. To see
                how to set up the generator box, check out this video.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                While your TVP balloon is deflated, pass the wire into the
                catheter until the 20cm mark is reached which is indicated by 2
                black lines on the wire. This ensures the balloon has exited the
                distal end of the catheter into the vein. Once the wire is in,
                you can now lock the proximal end of the sterility sheath to the
                outer end of the introducer sheath, then unravel the sterility
                sheath along the length of the wire. This will now keep your
                entire wire sterile and the wire can now be advanced or
                retracted as needed without contamination.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                At this point you can inflate the balloon and lock the stopcock
                to prevent deflation. With the generator box delivering an
                impulse, you may start to see small spikes on either the ECG
                machine if its connected or on the telemetry monitor. This
                indicates electrification of the vena cava.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Slowly advance the pacing wire with the balloon inflated so that
                it can follow the circulatory flow into the right atrium and
                then into the right ventricle. You can watch this video to help
                you identify where the wire is located based on the morphology.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you’ve identified the wire is in the right ventricle, you
                can deflate the balloon so that the wire doesn’t continue into
                the pulmonary artery, and after deflating the balloon, you can
                continue to pass it until it embeds into the ventricular wall.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once this occurs, you can tighten the proximal knob of the
                sterility sheath until the pacing wire is clamped down and will
                not accidentally advance or retract. To make sure the distal end
                of the sterility sheath is secure as well, there is a knob to
                clamp down that end, too.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Now that the wire is pacing appropriately, your wire is locked
                into place, and your setup is sterile, you are done! All you
                have to do now is keep an eye on the patient’s heart rate and be
                vigilant if capture is weak or lost.

              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                One of the most confusing parts about transvenous pacing is
                setting up the generator. Well not anymore.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you have access and have begun to set up your pacer wire
                insertion, ensure the distal end of the wire is connected to the
                appropriate positive and negative ports on the generator wire,
                and that the generator wire is plugged into the “V” port on the
                box. The “A” port is for atrial pacing while the “V” port is
                for, you guessed it, ventricular pacing.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Speaking of which, once you check for a new battery for the box,
                turn the generator on, test the locking button to ensure you are
                able ot later lock the buttons, and go to the knob for atrial
                voltage, usually denoted by an “A.” Turn this all the way down
                to zero; we won’t be atrial pacing in the ER.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                On the “V” ventricular knob, set your desired heart rate to
                whatever your goal is. Typically aiming for 80-110 is usually a
                safe bet unless otherwise indicated.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Lastly, crank your output, or mA setting all the way up to max.
                This is usually between 20 and 30mA. By doing this, you are
                ensuring that the generator will output enough energy to capture
                and override any existing intrinsic electrical activity.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you’ve floated the wire into place as described here, you
                should see both electrical and mechanical capture, and at this
                point can begin to lower your output voltage. Drop your voltage
                incrementally keeping your eye on the actual mechanical heart
                rate, not just the electrical pulse, and identify the voltage at
                which point you just lose capture. Then immediately turn the
                voltage back up to the absolute lowest number that maintains
                capture, then double that number, and that will be your set
                voltage to maintain capture.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you’ve done all of this, hit the lock button to make sure
                no one accidentally changes anything, and hang the generator on
                the bed, usually on the IV pole hook so it’s easily reached and
                seen.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Now you know the generator box from beginning to end.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Also remember, at any point if you want to briefly examine the
                patient’s underlying intrinsic rhythm and rate, you can press
                and hold the “PAUSE” button on the generator. This will pause
                the generator for as long as you are holding the button without
                altering any of your settings.

              <h5 class="procedure-video-heading">Venous Access</h5>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Prior to placing a transvenous pacemaker, one obviously needs to
                gain adequate access. Ideally, access is placed in the RIGHT
                internal jugular vein or the LEFT subclavian vein; access
                through either of these allows for a more streamlined approach
                given the anatomical pathway of each vessel, allowing a more
                direct path for the pacer to float.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                The type of access is critical as well. Your transvenous pacing
                kit will usually come with an appropriate venous introducer
                sheath kit, but in case it doesn’t, be sure to obtain a venous
                introducer sheath, commonly referred to by its trade name
                “Cordis” and also ensure you have the appropriate French size.
                This ensures a large enough bore to fit the pacing wire but also
                not too large a catheter that might potentially allow bleeding
                and backflow around the pacing wire.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                The process of inserting a venous introducer sheath is nearly
                identical to placing any central venous catheter, with a few
                caveats. The most important thing to remember prior to beginning
                your procedure that is different from a central venous catheter
                is that your dilator must be placed inside the introducer
                sheath, and both are passed over your guide wire as a single
                unit.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                To review briefly, start by located the appropriate vessel with
                ultrasound, and after ensuring sterility, insert your introducer
                needle aiming for the desired vein. Be sure to begin applying
                negative pressure to the plunger once the needle has entered the
                skin.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you obtain a flash and have fed your guide wire into the
                vein through your introducer needle, create a nik that is large
                enough to allow passage of your dilator-sheath combo. After
                creating your incision, pass the dilator-sheath combo over the
                guide wire into the vessel making sure to hub the sheath.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                Once you have done so, you can now remove the guide wire as well
                as the dilator out of the sheath, keeping the sheath in place
                inside the vessel. The one-way valve on the sheath will prevent
                backflow and at this point the sheath can now be sutured to the
                skin with the included suture needle.
              </p>
              <p class="procedure-video-text">
                That’s it! You now have large bore access for your transvenous
                pacer. Keep in mind, this is also the same procedure for
                inserting an introducer sheath for large volume resuscitation or
                any other procedure that requires an introducer sheath.
